#### Does Oku have a trial?

Yes, just download it and try out the full version. The only limitation is that you can only save a maximum of two texts.

#### How much does Oku cost?

It costs $49 during the launch period until 31 dec 2024. Regular price is $79 and there won't be any future sales. Remember,
that all future updates are free.

#### Is it subscription based?

No, you pay a one time fee. All futures updates are included for free.

#### Is it any good?

Yes.

#### Do you offer refunds?

Unfortunately I can not offer refunds for a digital product. Please download it and try it out first, before you purchase a license.

#### Which languages do you support?

#### I get a smart screen warning on windows. What to do?

You can ignore that one and allow the program to run. Signing windows applications has a huge fee for indie devs which I can not afford right now.

#### Does Oku have translations?

No, to offer translations would mean using services such as google translate which have monthly costs. 
As Oku is not subscription based I can not offer such a service. In addition some translators are better than others for specific languages. 
I recommend to open a browser with your favorite translator (google, deepl, yandex etc.) next to the oku window.
Offline dictionaries are part of the roadmap.
